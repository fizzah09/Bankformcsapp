# README: Program.cs
									
## Overview
This file is the entry point for the Bankformcsapp Windows Forms application. It is responsible for starting the application and launching the main form.

## Key Components
- **Namespace:** `Bankformcsapp`
- **Class:** `Program` (internal static)
- **Main Method:**
  - Decorated with `[STAThread]` for Windows Forms compatibility.
  - Calls `ApplicationConfiguration.Initialize()` to set up app-wide settings (e.g., DPI, font).
  - Runs the main form: `Application.Run(new Form1());`

## Purpose
- Initializes and starts the application.
- Does not contain business logic or UI code.
- All user interaction and banking logic are handled in `Form1.cs` and related files.

## Usage
- The application starts here and immediately shows the main window (`Form1`).
- No changes are typically needed unless you want to change the startup form or configuration.
